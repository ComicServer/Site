# ComicServer
ComicServer is a service that keeps you up to date with the fun part of the newspaper.

## Muncie Releases

### Muncie 8 (v6.7)
Muncie 8 is a subtle UI refresh that makes everything more accessible and easy to use. Navigate select comics with arrow keys (or buttons on mobile) and add new favorites through the SmartSearch bar. The whole website feels much more clean and less clunky.

### Muncie 7 (v6.6)
Muncie 7 adds a refreshed edit menu with visual elements making it easier and cleaner to edit your Home Screen. Muncie 7 also adds "Random Comic": a feature in which on page load will serve a random, recent comic (unless toggled off). We unfortunately removed custom themes to preserve quality all around the website. We also cleaned up the UI just a tiny bit more with inverted containers.

### Muncie 6 (v6.5)
This version feature ComicServer Daily, an automatic email sent to you with preset comics.

### Muncie 5 (v6.4)
ComicServer Muncie 5 adds the last rendition of account sign-in and slightly cleans up the UI.

The new account management system lets you sign in with a username and password and the UI is streamlined with a better styled SmartSearch bar and a brand-new font that is finally universal across all devices.


### Muncie 4 (v6.3)
This update introduces three new features, Sync, a redesigned interface, and password-less sign in, integrated right into ComicServer. Sync is a new mobile experience that focuses in on your favorites. All you have to do to set it up is simply go to the edit menu on desktop, and scan the QR code under "ComicServer Sync". Next is the new ComicServer Accounts system. We use device specific keys to set up a user for you and your favorites. All you have to do is enter a username. Lastly, we’ve partially updated the UI on the edit menu and header.

We also have a potential feature you could see in Muncie 5 or later. We are currently calling this plugin "Add to ComicServer" as it will do exactly that. It’ll refer you to a page in ComicServer that previews a comic or RSS feed that you can add to your favorites from.

### Muncie 3 + SmartSearch (v6.2.1)
SmartSearch is a tool that upgrades the way ComicServer's 'Start with a Comic' feature works. You may now search three different ways. By name, content in a comic, or with future dates. Just search and see the results.

### Muncie 3 (v6.2)
Muncie 3 is a major update to the already great Muncie series. This update adds Personalization Settings menu for your favorites homepage, to reduce clutter on the homepage. Along with the decluttered homepage comes unlimited comic and custom slots (for Discord connected users, guests get standard 8 comic slots). To top it off, a custom theme maker has also been added in Personalization Settings.

### Muncie 2 (v6.1)
Muncie 2 brings a huge backend improvement. With this update, you may connect your Discord account for easy access to a device-universal list of comics (curated by you).

### Muncie (v6, initial)
Muncie brings what Cesium couldn’t. We’ve added daily updating RSS powered comics (including a custom RSS slot). We’ve also added new themes for a great, personalized experience. This update also celebrates 2 years of ComicServer on May 4.

## Cesium Releases

### Primrose (v5.6)
Primrose introduces a new slot system. You may now get eight comics quick access from the home screen.

### Meadow (v5.5)
After Valley's record breaking streak of 2 months as an unparalleled subversion, Meadow takes it's place. Meadow acts as a refresher to Cesium and ComicServer after the core idea of Cesium (the fluid, colorful design) was lost. Meadow not only picks up Valley's slack, it adds so much more. At first glance this version looks like an update to Cesium/Vista. At second, though, these minor details show up. Meadow brings the fantastic backend of Valley and pairs it with an upgraded Vista-like experience.

### Valley (v5.4 - v5.4.22)
Valley is the second installment of ComicServer since the start of 2022. A new simplified experience brings the attention to phones and tablets, items that the user is more likely to open this site up on. We have mastered this experience by putting everything you need at your fingertips and nothing else.

### Vista (v5.3)
Future comics (+1 month of comic strips from a wide selection) have been added and Favorite Comics have been put into beta.)
