# ComicServer

## Muncie Releases

### Muncie 2 (v6.1)
Muncie 2 brings a huge backend improvement. With this update, you may connect your Discord account for easy access to a device-universal list of comics (curated by you).

### Muncie (v6, initial)
Muncie brings what Cesium couldn’t. We’ve added daily updating RSS powered comics (including a custom RSS slot). We’ve also added new themes for a great, personalized experience. This update also celebrates 2 years of ComicServer on May 4.

## Cesium Releases

### Primrose (v5.6)
Primrose introduces a new slot system. You may now get eight comics quick access from the home screen.

### Meadow (v5.5)
After Valley's record breaking streak of 2 months as an unparalleled subversion, Meadow takes it's place. Meadow acts as a refresher to Cesium and ComicServer after the core idea of Cesium (the fluid, colorful design) was lost. Meadow not only picks up Valley's slack, it adds so much more. At first glance this version looks like an update to Cesium/Vista. At second, though, these minor details show up. Meadow brings the fantastic backend of Valley and pairs it with an upgraded Vista-like experience.

### Valley (v5.4 - v5.4.22)
Valley is the second installment of ComicServer since the start of 2022. A new simplified experience brings the attention to phones and tablets, items that the user is more likely to open this site up on. We have mastered this experience by putting everything you need at your fingertips and nothing else.

### Vista (v5.3)
Future comics (+1 month of comic strips from a wide selection) have been added and Favorite Comics have been put into beta.)
